## Hey There, I’m Agustín Bianchi! 👋🏽

I’m an 18-year-old Software Engineering student at the University of Buenos Aires, fueled by a love for coding, problem-solving, and crafting awesome software. I’m all about diving into new technologies, tinkering with ideas, and leveling up my skills in the evolving tech world.

Take a peek at my repositories, drop an issue, or hit me up to team up on some cool projects—I’m always up for a challenge! 😊
